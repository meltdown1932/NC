# Nuclear
## Physics simulation

This game is designed to simulate the physics of temperature within a nuclear reactor core.

## Gameplay Overview

In this game, players take on the role of reactor operators tasked with controlling the reactor core to generate energy and earn money. However, the core must be managed carefully to prevent it from overheating and causing a catastrophic explosion. If the core overheats or if the player fails to maintain control, the game ends, and the save file is deleted, adding a high-stakes element to the gameplay.


## Features
- **Realistic Physics Simulation**: The program utilizes advanced physics algorithms to accurately model temperature dynamics within the reactor core.
- **Challenging Gameplay**: Players must carefully balance energy generation with temperature control to prevent catastrophic failures.
- **High-Stakes Consequences**: Failure to manage the reactor core effectively can result in game over and the loss of the save file, adding intensity and consequence to the gameplay experience.
- **Economic Management**: Earn money by efficiently operating the reactor and invest in upgrades and safety measures to improve long-term performance.
- **Dynamic Challenges**: Encounter various challenges and scenarios that test your reactor management skills, keeping gameplay engaging and unpredictable.

## Planned Updates
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Improve the user interface for better readability and easier control of reactor parameters.
- **Expanded Gameplay Mechanics**: Introduce new elements such as reactor types, fuel management, and emergency protocols to deepen the gameplay experience.
- **Community Feedback Integration**: Continuously gather feedback from players to address bugs, balance issues, and implement new features based on community suggestions.

Stay tuned for further updates and announcements as we continue to develop and refine the Nuclear Physics Simulation game!
